      Akshay Hari Om Bhatia[1] (born Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia; 9 September 1967[2]),
      known professionally as Akshay Kumar (pronounced [əkˈʂəj kʊˈmɑːɾ]), is an
      Indian actor and film producer working in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema"> Hindi cinema.</a>
      Referred to in the media as "Khiladi Kumar",[3][4] through his career
      spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared in over 150 films and has won
      several awards, including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare
      Awards. He received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian
      honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar is one of the most
      prolific actors in Indian cinema.[5][6] Forbes included Kumar in their
      lists of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the
      world from 2015 to 2020.[7][8] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only
      Indian on both lists.[9][10][11]

      Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial
      success a year later with the action thriller Khiladi. The film
      established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in
      the Khiladi film series, in addition to other action films such as Mohra
      (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his early tryst with romance in Yeh
      Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that
      Kumar expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic
      films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003), Namastey London (2007), and for his
      slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000),
      Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa
      (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar won Filmfare Awards for his
      negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala
      (2005). In addition to acting, Kumar has worked as a stunt actor.[a] In
      2008, he started hosting Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi, which he did for
      four seasons. He also launched the TV reality show Dare 2 Dance in 2014
      and his off-screen work includes ownership of the team Khalsa Warriors in
      the World Kabaddi League. The actor had also set up martial arts training
      schools for women safety in the country.[14][15] Kumar is one of the
      India's most philanthropic actor and supports various charities. He is a
      leading brand endorser celebrity in India.[16] From 2011 to 2023, he was a
      citizen of Canada.[17][18][19]

      While his career had fluctuated commercially, his mainstream success
      soared in 2007 with four consecutive box-office hits; it was consistent
      until a short period of decline between 2009 and 2011, after which he
      reinforced his status with several films, including Rowdy Rathore (2012)
      and Holiday (2014). Moreover, around this time critical response to
      several of his films improved; his work in Special 26 (2013), Baby (2015),
      Airlift (2016), and Jolly LLB 2 (2017) was acclaimed, and he won the
      National Film Award for Best Actor for the crime thriller Rustom (2016).
      He earned further notice for his self-produced social films Toilet: Ek
      Prem Katha (2017) and Pad Man (2018), as well as the war film Kesari
      (2019), and set box-office records in 2019 with Mission Mangal, Housefull
      4, Good Newwz, and the 2021 action film Sooryavanshi. All of Kumar's
      subsequent theatrical releases failed commercially, with the exception of
      the comedy-drama OMG 2 (2023).[12]
